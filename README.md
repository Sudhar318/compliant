# SmartTrack TN 🚦 — AI-Powered Civic Complaint Resolution Platform

SmartTrack TN is a highly optimized, production-ready full-stack backend services suite built on Node.js 20, TypeScript, Express.js, and Prisma. The platform streamlines and automates emergency and citizen complaint resolution workflows across Tamil Nadu, India, using Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via the modern `@google/genai` model SDK) to automatically classify, prioritize, and route reports to specific zonal officers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Key Specifications

*   **Runtime Environment:** Node.js 20 + TypeScript + tsx
*   **Web Framework:** Express.js + CORS + Cookie-Parser + Multer
*   **Database Mapping:** Prisma ORM with SQLite (standard on workspaces for zero-configuration, seamless preview execution) and cross-compatible with PostgreSQL for production.
*   **Security & Encryption:** JWT (Access cookie + Rotating HTTPOnly Refresh pair) with custom in-memory token blacklisting for zero-dependency secure logout. Passwords salted and hashed via Pure-JS `bcryptjs`.
*   **Artificial Intelligence:** Gemini 1.5 Flash / Gemini 3.5 Flash via `@google/genai` for categorisation, sentiment assessment, summaries, and resolution timeline estimations.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Built-in Event-Driven Background Worker Queues (`aiQueue` & `notificationQueue`) operating concurrently to process Gemini API payloads offline without blocking active thread pools.
*   **Notifications Dispatcher:** Built-in support for Twilio SMS gateway integration and in-app system log trails.
*   **Testing Engine:** Vitest in-memory assertion engine.

## ⚡ Setup & Launch Instructions

### 1. Configure Local Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file at the root using the variables described in `.env.example`:
```env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
JWT_SECRET="smarttrack_jwt_super_secret_key_123_456_789"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="smarttrack_jwt_refresh_super_secret_key_123_456_789"
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY"  # Optional: logs fallbacks automatically if blank
```

### 2. Install Workspace Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Build & Sync SQLite Tables
Verify data mappings, build schema structures, and map the DB Client:
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 4. Load High-Fidelity Dataset Seed
Populates the SQL schema with **1 Admin user, 3 Officers, 1 Citizen, 5 detailed complaints**, and **linked status logs**:
```bash
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

### 5. Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
The console will boot Express on http://0.0.0.0:3000 with auto-reloads active.

### 6. Run Integrated Test Suites
Execute our testing suite containing security, hashing, JWT structures, trackingId, and adaptive categorisation:
```bash
npx vitest run
```

### 🤖 4. Gemini Automation & Auto Routing Service

SmartTrack TN integrates closely with standard Gemini classification. The pipeline functions asynchronously as described:

1.  **Submission:** The citizen posts a complaint. The server validates properties and generates a unique ID (e.g. `TN-98563`) and returns instantly to prevent user page loading freezes.
2.  **Queueing:** A background task is scheduled in the Event-Driven worker `aiQueue`.
3.  **Gemini Call:** The background worker compiles a specialized prompt containing Tamil Nadu departments, and instructs `@google/genai` to return exact JSON with:
    *   `category` (ROADS, ELECTRICITY, etc.)
    *   `department` (e.g., "TANGEDCO")
    *   `priority` (CRITICAL, HIGH, etc.)
    *   `sentiment` (Concerned, Emergency, etc.)
    *   `aiSummary` (One sentence digest in English)
    *   `estimatedResolutionHours`
4.  **Auto-Assignment:** Based on the parsed department and ward fields, the database is queried to select the **active officer** with the lowest current workload score (`activeAssignments`).
5.  **Audit & Notify:** The complaint status changes to `PENDING`. Status logs are registered, and SMS/push alerts are fired to the officer.

If no `GEMINI_API_KEY` is present, the service automatically implements a high-performance rule-based keyword analyzer mapping local departments, preserving full system operational viability during sandbox development phases.
